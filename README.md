## ⚡ Strategic Update: AI Shield at a Crossroads

After 30+ years in technology—from MS-DOS to AI security—I've built **AI Shield**: an 18-module framework for AI threat detection, forensics, and incident response.

**Compliant with:**
→ EU AI Act  
→ ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System)  
→ NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
→ ISO/IEC 23894 (AI Risk Management)

**The decision:** Partnership with a compliance platform vs. open source release.

**The pattern is clear:**
- Kubernetes commoditized containers
- Terraform forced AWS to adapt
- Prometheus disrupted monitoring

**Open source wins in security tooling because security teams trust code they can audit.**

**If AI Shield goes open source:**
- Enterprises deploy it for free (global AI compliance covered)
- They ask: "Why am I paying £15K-£40K/year for compliance platforms when operational security is free?"
- Compliance platforms become "documentation tools"

**The alternative:** Strategic partnership with one platform. Exclusive integration. Competitive moat.

**Decision timeline:** Under evaluation through February 2026.

**CISOs and platform executives—take note.**

## 🎯 Overview
Red Specter focuses on practical visibility and response across:
- Botnet activity and early-stage DDoS signals  
- C2-style outbound behaviour and beaconing  
- Sudden service exposure and brute-force patterns  
- AI-era risks: shadow AI usage, prompt injection, data leakage, and model integrity  
- Fast containment and **evidence-first reporting**

This profile README is a high-level inventory with links to each repo.

**A fully integrated, production-ready platform for AI security governance and incident response.**

Red Specter AI Shield unifies **18 security modules**—from prevention to forensic response—into a single deployable suite.  
It provides the **operational security layer** that compliance platforms cannot deliver.

### 🎯 What Compliance Platforms Miss

Current compliance platforms provide:
- Policy templates and questionnaires
- Documentation frameworks
- Audit trail management

**What they don't provide:**
- Tamper-evident evidence chains
- Forensic artifact collection
- Real-time incident response capabilities
- Demonstrable operational controls

**Regulations demand operational proof:**
- **EU AI Act Article 12:** Logging and traceability requirements
- **ISO/IEC 42001:** Demonstrable AI management controls
- **NIST AI RMF:** Continuous monitoring and risk management
- **ISO/IEC 23894:** Operational risk assessment

AI Shield delivers what regulations actually require—not just documentation.

### 🚀 Core Capabilities

✅ **Integrated Platform:** 18 modules on a unified event schema (**RS Event v1**)  
✅ **Forensic Evidence:** Automated, tamper-evident case packaging (timeline + IOCs + hashes)  
✅ **Operational Coverage:** **18 playbooks** mapped to modules + sanity coverage checker  
✅ **CSOAI-ready Export:** Submission summary + export bundle + checksums (Watchdog-style evidence packaging)  
✅ **Local GUI:** 4-button web interface for golden-path workflows (Preflight → Init → Build → Verify)  
✅ **Cross-Platform:** Full Linux/WSL2 support, automated Windows installer available  
✅ **Compliance Ready:** EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 23894 alignment

## 🎯 Why This Matters Now

The threat landscape has fundamentally shifted with AI-powered attacks reaching industrial scale.

Red Specter's stance is simple:
1. **Detect early** — Spot threats before they cause damage
2. **Block where you can** — Prevent unauthorized actions at policy chokepoints
3. **Contain fast** — Rapid response with one-command containment
4. **Prove everything** — Evidence-first: hashes, timelines, tamper-evident case packs

### 🔴 Current Threat Landscape

- **AI-powered phishing** reaching unprecedented sophistication
- **Shadow AI usage** creating compliance and data leakage risks
- **Prompt injection** attacks bypassing traditional security controls
- **Model poisoning** targeting RAG systems and fine-tuned models
- **Deepfake fraud** in voice/video authentication
- **Regulatory pressure** demanding demonstrable operational controls

**AI Shield addresses these threats with integrated prevention, detection, and forensic response—delivering the operational layer that compliance frameworks require but platforms cannot provide.**
