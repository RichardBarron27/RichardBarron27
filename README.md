## The AI Security Reality

**$1 attack cost. 90% success rate. 27,500x ROI for attackers.**

Wiz Research demonstrated AI agents can exploit enterprise vulnerabilities for under $1 each. OpenAI has stated prompt injection "is unlikely to ever be fully solved." 65% of IT leaders admit their defenses are inadequate against AI-driven attacks.

Compliance platforms document *what should happen*. **AI Shield ensures it actually does.**

## 🛡️ AI Shield: Operational Security for Autonomous AI Agents

AI Shield is a **26-module** security platform implementing Gartner's **AI Runtime Inspection & Enforcement** layer within the AI TRiSM framework.

### Platform Overview

| Component | Modules | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Core Platform** | 1-18 | Prevention, Detection, Response, Evidence |
| **Agent Security Suite** | 19-25 | Complete agent lifecycle protection |
| **Doomsday Protocol** | 99 | Emergency kill switch |

### 🔴 Module 99: Doomsday Protocol

**The Emergency Kill Switch for Autonomous AI Agents**

When your AI agents go rogue, compliance documentation won't save you. **Module 99 will.**

- **One button. Every agent stops. Instantly.**
- Pre-termination evidence capture with cryptographic signing
- Credential revocation cascade across all identity providers
- Network isolation enforcement
- Regulatory notification package auto-generated
- **Sub-5-second execution**

EU AI Act Article 14 requires a "stop button" for AI systems. **This is it.**

> *"The module you hope you never need. The module regulators will ask if you had."*

## 📊 Complete OWASP Coverage

AI Shield provides **complete coverage** of both OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 and OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026.

**No other platform offers this.**

| OWASP Agentic Risk | AI Shield Coverage |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| ASI01: Agent Goal Hijack | Module 19 |
| ASI02: Tool/Action Misuse | Module 19 |
| ASI03: Identity/Privilege Abuse | Module 20 |
| ASI04: Output Data Leakage | Module 24 |
| ASI05: Poisoned Training Data | Module 22 |
| ASI06: Memory Poisoning | Module 23 |
| ASI07: Inter-Agent Protocol Exploit | Module 21 |
| ASI08: Human-Agent Trust Exploitation | Module 25 |
| ASI09: Resource DoS | Module 19 |
| ASI10: Rogue Agent | **Module 99** |

## 🏛️ Gartner AI TRiSM Alignment

AI Shield implements Layer 4 of Gartner's AI TRiSM framework: **AI Runtime Inspection & Enforcement**.

> *"While more enterprises have formal AI governance strategies in place, very few have successfully operationalized them."* — Gartner, February 2025

**The policy-to-practice gap is growing. AI Shield bridges it.**

## 🌍 Regulatory Compliance

| Regulation | AI Shield Coverage |
|------------|-------------------|
| **EU AI Act Article 12** | Automatic event recording (RS Event telemetry, Case Packs) |
| **EU AI Act Article 13** | Transparency (Module 25 decision provenance) |
| **EU AI Act Article 14** | Human oversight & stop button (**Module 99**) |
| **GDPR** | Cross-border data sovereignty (Module 24) |
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | Demonstrable operational controls |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Continuous monitoring and management |

**EU AI Act major obligations apply August 2, 2026.**
