## The AI Security Reality

**$1 attack cost. 90% success rate. 27,500x ROI for attackers.**

Wiz Research demonstrated AI agents can exploit enterprise vulnerabilities for under $1 each. OpenAI has stated prompt injection "is unlikely to ever be fully solved." 65% of IT leaders admit their defenses are inadequate against AI-driven attacks.

Compliance platforms document *what should happen*. **AI Shield ensures it actually does.**
