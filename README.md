Who We Are

Red Specter builds ethical, AI-powered cyber-defense tools.
We specialise in threats traditional security stacks miss: AI misuse, emotional manipulation, covert C2 channels, behavioural anomalies, and low-signal attacks.
Our focus is early detection, explainability, and locally run defensive tooling.

The Problem

Cybersecurity is shifting from infrastructure to interaction.
Attackers increasingly exploit AI systems, human behaviour, outbound traffic patterns, and subtle coordination techniques.
Most organisations have little or no visibility into these layers.

Our Solution

Red Specter develops precise, explainable, privacy-first security tools that surface early-stage compromise signals across AI, network, and host environments.
