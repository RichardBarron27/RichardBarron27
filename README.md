# 👁‍🗨 Red Specter — AI Defense Tools
🛡️ AI security & prompt-level data leakage detection

Hi, I’m **Richard ** — cybersecurity engineer and creator of the **Red Specter Offensive Framework** and the **Red Specter AI Breach Monitor**.

I build lawful, effective, and business-ready tooling for:

- Reconnaissance  
- OSINT operations  
- Web & network enumeration  
- Evidence collection & reporting  
  

My current focus is combining **offense-driven defense** with **AI safety** – helping teams experiment with AI while staying within safe, governed boundaries.

Always authorized. Always ethical. Always learning. ⚔️
