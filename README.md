Who We Are

Red Specter builds ethical, AI-powered cyber-defense tools.
 We specialise in threats that traditional security stacks miss:
 emotional manipulation, covert C2 channels, AI misuse, and behavioural anomalies.

The Problem

Cybersecurity is shifting from infrastructure to interaction.
 Attackers now exploit:

 • AI systems

 • human behaviour

 • outbound traffic patterns

 • low-signal, high-impact techniques

Most organisations have no visibility into these layers.

Our Solution

Red Specter develops precise, explainable, locally-run security tools that detect early-stage compromise signals across:

AI Security

• AI Firewall Proxy

 • AI Breach Monitor

 • Endpoint Guard

Network & Host Defense

• Beacon Detector (state-of-the-art behavioural C2 detection)

 • Botnet Radar

 • DDoS Flood Detector

 • C2 Hunter

 • Port Surge Detector

 • Log Scanner

Offensive / OSINT

• Red Specter Offensive Framework

 • Evidence Ledger

 • Email OSINT Tool

Private R&D

• Companion Sentinel — emotional-manipulation detection

 • Red Defender — autonomous AI defensive agents

 • Botnet Radar Pro — predictive botnet telemetry

 • Internal Beacon Detector — compromised host identification

Our Mission

Ethical. Precise. Unseen.

We build tools that reveal the threats others don’t even know to look for.

Red Specter — Innovation Beyond Belief
