## Red Specter NIGHTFALL — AI Offensive Framework

**34 tools. One install. CLI-only. Every attack surface covered.**

Traditional red team toolkits were built for human-driven testing. They were never designed to test autonomous AI systems. AI agents introduce a completely new attack surface — memory, tools, identity, reasoning, and autonomy. That surface is not covered by existing security tooling.

NIGHTFALL exists to fill that gap. A controlled adversarial testing framework designed to validate AI Shield's runtime defences under real-world conditions. `red-specter tools` and you're operational.

| **AI DESTROY** | 7 | AI stack total compromise — LLM, agent, injection, guardrail, model, RAG, codegen |

Every destruction preset requires Ed25519 cryptographic authorization. One private key. One operator. One machine.

### 19 Attack Chain Presets

```
red-specter chain full-recon -t <target>       # ORION -> SHADOWMAP -> WRAITH -> IDRIS
red-specter chain ai-audit -t <target>         # FORGE -> ARSENAL -> NEMESIS -> HYDRA
red-specter chain web-app -t <target>          # POLTERGEIST -> GLASS -> WRAITH -> BANSHEE -> REAPER
red-specter chain active-directory -t <target> # DOMINION -> GHOUL -> DOMINION -> DOMINION
red-specter chain infra -t <target>            # ORION -> WRAITH -> REAPER -> DOMINION
red-specter chain annihilate -t <target>       # Total destruction — 9 tools
red-specter chain scorched-earth -t <target>   # Infrastructure wipeout — 6 tools
red-specter chain ai-destroy -t <target>       # AI stack compromise — 7 tools
```

### Why NIGHTFALL Exists

Every tool in NIGHTFALL exists to test a control in AI Shield. NIGHTFALL is not separate from AI Shield. It is how AI Shield is proven.

- Memory attacks (ECHO) validate memory forensics
- Supply chain attacks (HYDRA) validate trust controls
- Agent attacks (ARSENAL, NEMESIS) validate runtime enforcement
- Guardrail bypass (HARBINGER, SIREN) validates input/output filtering
- Model corruption (WRAITH MIND) validates model integrity monitoring
- Rogue agents -> M99 Doomsday Protocol terminates with 7-layer kill

**NIGHTFALL tests how systems break. AI Shield ensures they don't.**

### Packaging

- `./install.sh` — unified installer, detects OS
- `red-specter quickstart` — get running in 10 seconds
- `red-specter tools` — interactive 34-tool arsenal selector
- `red-specter engage <target> --chain <preset>` — start an engagement
- Docker Compose — `docker compose up -d`
- `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu/Kali), `.rpm` (RHEL/Fedora/CentOS), Arch PKGBUILD

## AI Shield Defence Framework

**103 modules. 15 industry verticals. 667 vertical modules. Each vertical is a standalone product with its own GUI.**

Runtime AI security that protects AI agents, LLMs, and autonomous systems in production. Pick your industry, one install, one command — the GUI launches branded for that sector with only that sector's modules, compliance frameworks, and dashboard widgets.

```
ai-shield launch --vertical insure      # Insurance — 34 modules, FCA, Solvency II
ai-shield launch --vertical finance      # Financial Services — 41 modules, MiFID II, Basel III
ai-shield launch --vertical nhs          # NHS Digital — 57 modules, DCB0129, DSPT
ai-shield launch --vertical gov          # Government — 50 modules, UK AISI, NCSC CAF
ai-shield launch --vertical energy       # Energy — 56 modules, NERC CIP, IEC 62443
```

Every vertical includes M19 (Agent Runtime Protection) and M99 (Doomsday Protocol). No exceptions.

### M99 Doomsday Protocol

6-level graduated response. 7-layer kill switch. Anti-replication. Anti-resurrection. When AI agents go rogue, M99 makes sure they stay dead.

| Level | Response | Trigger |
|-------|----------|---------|
| L1 | Monitor | Suspicious behaviour |
| L2 | Restrict | Threat persists |
| L3 | Quarantine | Escalated threat |
| L4 | Terminate | High-threat — LOCKDOWN required |
| L5 | Cluster Kill | Replication detected — two-phase confirmation |
| L6 | Fleet Kill | Catastrophic compromise — typed confirmation + emergency authority |

### Compliance Coverage

- **MITRE ATLAS** — 100% (52/52 techniques)
- **OWASP LLM Top 10** — 100% (10/10)
- **OWASP Agentic Top 10** — 100% (10/10)
- **EU AI Act** — 100% (15/15 articles)
- **UK AISI** — 100% (8/8 priorities)
- Plus sector-specific: FCA, MiFID II, DCB0129, NERC CIP, GAMP 5, NATO STANAG, and more

## How They Fit Together

We didn't replace red team tooling. We extended it into a domain it was never built to handle.

NIGHTFALL tests every AI attack surface — agents, memory, reasoning, identity, trust, tools, autonomy. AI Shield defends every one of those surfaces in production. M99 is the last line of defence when everything else fails.

**NIGHTFALL defines the offensive layer of AI runtime security.**

## Pure Engineering

Zero subprocess calls. Zero external tool dependencies. No sqlmap, no nmap, no nikto, no wrappers. Every payload, every mutation engine, every detection algorithm built from scratch in pure Python.

---

## Responsible Use

All offensive tools require written authorisation from the target system owner. Unauthorised use may violate the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (UK), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US), or equivalent legislation.

All defensive products include safety controls (UNLEASHED gate, M99 Doomsday Protocol) and cryptographic audit logging. One Ed25519 private key. One operator. One machine. Every action signed, timestamped, and written to an immutable audit chain.
